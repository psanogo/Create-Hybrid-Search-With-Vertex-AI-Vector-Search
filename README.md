Here's a foundational architecture for your system:

Global Load Balancer: To provide a single, global entry point for all user traffic, ensuring low-latency access and efficient request distribution.
Frontend Service (Cloud Run): A serverless microservice acting as the user interface, automatically scaling based on traffic.
Retrieval Service (Cloud Run): The core backend microservice orchestrating the search and AI workflow, processing requests, querying the knowledge base, and interacting with Vertex AI.
PostgreSQL Database: Serving as your private knowledge base, capable of storing and searching vector embeddings for semantic similarity.
Vertex AI: Providing access to powerful large language models for generating informed responses.
Secret Manager: Securely storing credentials for your PostgreSQL database.
This initial design focuses on the core components for a robust and scalable solution.
